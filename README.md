1 (Beginning)
_(Backstage of an amateur youth production of Julius Caesar, made of a cloakroom with a door to outside, a green room, and, in the middle, a mixed dressing room with a flimsy partition. There is a small space in front of the set, which signifies the grimy car park outside.  
Most of the cast are 16 and younger, with a couple of 18-17 year olds, in the main cast’s case. One or two are milling nervously in the green room, but the Stage Manager herds them up the nearby stairs.  
Brutus, dressed in full Roman getup, comes back into the cloakroom, as he tosses away a cigarette.  
Caesar dashes through the car park, skids round to the door, and shoves it open, hitting Brutus’s arm.)_  
**Brutus: **Christ!  
**Caesar: **Sorry, Dan- damnit- er- Brutus.  
**Brutus: **Could have killed me! _(he hesitates)_ Wait a minute.  
_(He looks at her accusingly.)_  
**Caesar: **I said Brutus! I said Brutus!  
_(She gets caught in her coat sleeve. Brutus helps.)_  
**Brutus: **You never. _(nods at the money tin) _Go on.  
**Caesar: **Such a pedant. Put one in for me, please.   
**Brutus: **Which-?  
**Caesar: **Left pocket.  
_(Brutus puts 50p in the box.)_  
**Brutus: **Isn’t Cass with you?  
**Caesar:** Doctor’s appointment.  
**Brutus: **What’s he done now?  
**Caesar:** He came into English with his finger all black, and I went: “Cass”- although, obviously not “Cass”- I went: “Cass, you should go to the doctor’s about that” and he went: “…Really?” and the teacher went: “Cass, you should really go to the doctor’s about that.” and he kind of sighed and went “…Really?” and we went: “Yeah.” and he went: “Ok.” so, he went.  
**Brutus:** Fair enough.  
_(Stage Manager appears, an older lady wearing blacks and a utility belt.)_  
**Stage Manager:** Caesar, thank God you’re here- Brutus! If you keep smoking in costume, I’m not paying for the cleaning, Cass- where is Cassius?  
**Caesar & Brutus:** Doctor’s appointment.  
**Stage Manager: **Well, why didn’t either of you numpties text or ring me?  
**Caesar:** I’m really sorry, I was about to do it- and- and some stuff happened-  
**Stage Manager: **Can he be here for 5:50? And that is the absolute latest.  
**Caesar: **He wouldn’t not come! Not on the last night, he ain’t like that, but- well, but-  
_(She makes an uncertain gesture and glances at Brutus.)_  
**Brutus: **...Yeah, it’s Cassius, isn’t it?  
**Stage Manager:** Well, we’ll do the best we can in the meantime, and figure something out if needed- Caesar, get in the changing rooms, and Brutus, you can-  
_(Cassius sprints through the car park, erupts through the cloakroom door and throws his coat onto Brutus.)_  
**Cass: **I’m here! I’m here! I’m here! I’m here!  
**Brutus:** _(muffled)_ Wow, really?  
**Cass:** Caesar!  
_(Cass grabs Caesar, they dash into the dressing room and go to either side of the partition.)_  
**Cass: **You got my text? You went to mine, yeah?  
**Caesar: **Yes, I saw Darren.  
**Cass:** D’you make him some dinner?  
**Caesar:** Fish fingers.  
**Cass: **Brilliant. He wasn’t worried or anything, right?  
** Stage Manager:** _(calling into the room) _Stop chatting and get on the bloody stage!  
_(She herds everyone out, and goes to stand by the noticeboard in the cloakroom.  
The clock hands speed up. Cast members run on and offstage, while Stage Manager helps characters in and out of cloaks and hats, takes props off people, hands them to others, until Caesar, Brutus and Antony (Brutus’s girlfriend), screech to a halt in the green room. 
Storm sound effects can be heard from the stage above. Caesar exhales deeply and sits. Antony starts messing with Brutus’s fringe.)_  
## 2 (First Caesar conversation)  
**Brutus: **Caesar, you are way out of it tonight.  
**Antony: **Yeah, what even happened in Scene 2?  
**Caesar: **I know- I’m really sorry, I think it’s all the late nights. I had a full day at college, too.  
Antony: Aww-  
_(She gives Caesar a little hug.)_  
**Antony:** Just one night left, hey? You can do it.  
**Caesar: **Yeah.  
_(Silence for a little while. Brutus and Antony glance at each other.)_  
**Brutus: **Sure you’re alright? You were late today.  
**Caesar:** Went to Cass’s. His parents are off somewhere, dinner or somewhere, and he had the doctor’s appointment, so he rang at literally the last second and asked me to go and check on Darren. Do his dinner, and that.  
_(Another small silence.)_  
**Antony: **So..?  
**Caesar: **He was fine.  
_(Yet another small silence.)_  
**Brutus: **That’s good.  
**Caesar:** Yeah. It is good.  
_(A further silence.  
 Antony sits by her. She looks at Caesar. Caesar looks at her, then at Brutus, who looks right back. Caesar laughs nervously.)_  
**Caesar:** What?  
**Antony:** You’re messing us about.  
**Caesar:** I am absolutely not messing you about!  
**Brutus:** You're messing us about. _(beat) _Did something happen over there?  
**Antony: **With Darren? Is Darren alright?  
**Caesar:** Course he is, I- how can you possibly- the- it’s- you have absolutely-  
_(She eventually gives up and goes quiet. Antony glances at the door.)_  
**Antony: **I think everyone else is outside playing dobby-little-man until Act 2 Scene 3, so...  
_(Caesar looks at Antony for a moment, then at Brutus for another moment. Antony gestures expectantly.  
Brutus suddenly hears an important line from the stage.)_  
**Brutus: **Shit, I’m on in a second, sorry-  
_(Stage Manager opens the green room door.)_  
**Stage Manager:** Brutus!  
**Brutus:** Coming.  
_(He goes. Antony watches him for a second, then looks back at Caesar. Another pause.) _  
**Caesar: **You will actually hate me.  
**Antony:** I actually won’t.  
_(Caesar takes a breath.)_  
**Caesar: **Ok, alright, so, I went to Cass’s to see if Darren was alright. His parents are out, he was up at the doctor’s for his finger, the one on the way to town. He didn’t have time to come back, so he asked me to make sure Darren ate something.  
**Antony:** Ok.  
_(Caesar recomposes herself.  
Cicero comes down the stairs, through the dressing room, opens the green room door a fraction, senses the important conversation, and closes it. He hesitates, then presses his ear to the wall.)_  
**Caesar: **So, I went down there and- _(she pauses.) _Well, I went in, and he wasn’t there. That’s fine, ‘cos he’s really scared of anyone who isn’t Cass. What I did was, I- I put the kettle on, so he’d hear it, and it would be, like, a non-intrusive way of letting him know I was in the house and I was a normal human being.  
**Antony:** Fair enough.  
**Caesar: **I went to the stairs and called up ‘Darren, Darren’, and he was still nowhere, so I thought, that’s fine too, he’s probably upstairs, sleeping, so I went up, and he was in Cass’s room, on the bed. Just…way too still. Y’know.  
_(Antony and Cicero’s hands drift to their mouths in growing horror.)_  
**Antony:** Oh. My God. Didn’t you call someone?  
**Caesar:** I panicked- I- I just ran out of there. Ran out, down the street, got on the bus- well, the bus was late- waited for the bus, got on it, came here.  
_(She nibbles the edge of her toga.)_  
**Antony: **Darren’s still in the house?  
_(Caesar nods.)_  
**Antony: **Just- _(whispers, glances around)_ -just _dead_?  
_(More anguished nodding. Stage Manager comes back from outside, with the rest of the cast and heads to the green room. Cicero jumps away from the wall and acts natural.)_  
**Stage Manager:** _(to Cicero) _What are you up to, eh?  
_(Cicero shrugs and scurries away. She goes on into the green room.)_  
**Stage Manager:** Sorry to interrupt anything, but you need to get on stage, ASAP. Them up there are nearly done.  
_(She leaves. Antony goes back to looking at Caesar accusingly.)_  
**Caesar: **I panicked!  
_(They leave for stairs on opposite sides. 
##(3) Establish Caesar and Cass are gay, Cicero blackmails everyone  
Another whirl of activity backstage. At one point, Brutus and Cassius amongst others grab plastic knives from a table. Cass immediately drops his because of his bandaged finger. Caius Ligarius hides hers in her bra until the Stage Manager makes her put it in a pocket. Everyone sprints up the stairs and most come back, covered in blood.  
A moment of quiet in the green room for Caesar, Cass, Brutus and Antony.  
Brutus has his head on Antony's shoulder and they sit together, whispering, until Antony catches Cass and Caesar staring at them wearily.)_  
**Antony: **What's that for?  
_(Long pause)_  
**Cass: **So, right, I've got nothing against straight people.  
**Antony:** Oh yeah?  
**Cass:** But do you have to be so straight all the time?  
**Caesar: **Yes, it seems tiring.  
**Brutus: **What d'you want me to do? Suck a dick on Sundays?  
**Antony:**_ (whispers)_ Oh my God, Brutus!  
_(She gestures at the younger cast members)_  
**Brutus: **What? Metellus has sucked a dick. Ain't you?  
_(Metellus glances round. Everyone looks at him.)_  
**Metellus: **Er, yeah.  
**Brutus:** How was it?  
_(Everyone is still looking at him. Metellus is momentarily fazed by the attention.)_  
**Metellus:** Alright, I suppose.  
_(Suddenly, several characters run down the stairs, and into the green room, covered in blood and helpless with laughter. Stage Manager sharply shushes them.  
Everyone is silent, watching the Stage Manager expectantly for what seems like an age.  
Her walkie-talkie bleeps, making everyone jump.)_  
**Stage Manager: **That is the interval, people.  
_(Some hushed “Yes!”-es from the cast.)_  
**Stage Manager: **Please go to the loo if you need it, go for a biscuit in the green room if you want one, go for a smoke if it’s legal. Interval always goes faster than you think, so please be conscious of the time-  
_(No-one is listening by this point.)_

 (Antony leaves before Stage Manager can intervene. Brutus, Caesar and   

---  
Antony: It’s like, actual metal as well. Where’d the snapped-off bit go?  
Stage Manager: According to Murellus, it nearly hit Cicero’s poor granny in the face.  
Antony: I seen her! I’ll sort it when I’m next out there, I’ll just kick it somewhere.  
Stage Manager: No!  
Antony: It’s fine, when we did Crucible, Brutus kicked a frog into the orchestra pit and no-one noticed.
